# PACRB
PACRB: Pixel Art Color Ramping Builder

PACRB is a tool to help pixel artist create seemless and beautiful palletes easily.
PACRB has a color ramper that will allow you to create palletes seamlessly.

## Download

https://github.com/slohobostudios/PACRB/releases/tag/0.1.0

# NOTES

PACRB does not, and will not support alpha values (transparency values)

PACRB is in a very early stage. Here are some features I am planning to add:

A gear icon on the top right of the window that will pop up a menu that has:
  Save/Load
  keybinds
  shortcuts
  commands

I do plan on having the save/load feature behind a paywall on steam, but the demo
will have most of the features. The demo can be downloaded on github under 
packages!

# INSTRUCTIONS
